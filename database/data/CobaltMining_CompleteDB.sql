About 300 feet S. 35� W. of the tunnel portal are several small outcrops of sulfide-bearing rocks surrounded by barren material, which may represent offshoots of the Tunnel body or which may be. Very small individual bodies. The average nickel content of the samples taken from this body in the tunnel was 0.52 percent, but this probably is not entirely representative, because the ends of the body were not sampled and they appear to be of somewhat lower grade.

This body is limited about 100 feet southwest of Pit 12 by outcrops of hornfels and about 75 feet to the north by an outcrop of barren norite. The south end of Pit 19 is probably in the same body as Pit 12, but most of the former pit is in material so low in nickel and sulfides that the body was not considered to extend farther north than the southernmost 25 feet of that pit.

The hornfels exposed in Pit 4, in conjunction with other nearby outcrops, definitely limits any extension of the sulfide-bearing body to the east and northeast. Hornfels also crops out about 50 feet southeast of Pit 5, thus limiting the body in that direction. The outcrops between Pits 3 and 5 limit the body to the northwest at its north end. Although the rock exposed over a large area at the north end of Pit 5 is of low nickel content, it is considered to be part of a large sulfide-bearing body opened by Pits 4, 5, and 7, because sulfide-bearing outcrops are found between Pits 4 and 5 and close to Pit 5.

It consists of three layers, a top brick-red soil layer, an intermediate thick yellow limonitic layer with some quartz-garnierite boxwork, and a root layer composed of quartz-garnierite boxwork in nearly fresh bedrock that is a transitional phase between weathered material and fresh peridotite. The disposition of the boxwork veins was controlled by original blocky jointing in the peridotite. Nickel occurs in all three layers of the blanket but is most abundant in the boxwork veins carrying garnierite. The darker green varieties of the garnierite contain the highest percentage of nickel. The nickel is believed to have been derived from olivine in the peridotite by decomposition during lateritic weathering, which probably took place during late Tertiary time, before the present regional surface at an elevation of 2,000 feet was dissected.
